## Data Structures Adobpted

 - **Priority Queue**: a `priority queue` was used to bubble nodes with the shortset `f score` to the top 
 - **Sets** : pythong `set` was used to fast look up to be sure we don't reconsider a node already in consideration
 - **Dictionary**: used to store all possible nodes under consideration and update values of `f` and `g` `scores`
